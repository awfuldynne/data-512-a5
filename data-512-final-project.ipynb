    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to understand how information technology (IT) workers feel about mental health issues. \"Although research has gone far to understand the impact of the disease, it has only recently begun to explain stigma in mental illness. Much work yet needs to be done to fully understand the breadth and scope of prejudice against people with mental illness.\" [[1]](#References) Two surveys conducted by [Open Sourcing Mental Illness Ltd](https://osmihelp.org/research/) (OSMI) collected information around the perceived stigma of mental health issues as well as to \"...examine the frequency of mental health disorders among tech workers.\"[[2]](#References). OSMI has conducted these surveys in 2014 and 2016 to identify areas where they can raise awareness around mental health in the tech community.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be comparing potential differences in the surveys between the two years it was run as well as analyzing if views on mental health have changed between the two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am a data scientist who has been working in a variety of roles in the tech industry since 2010. Having been impacted by mental health issues myself, I believe that promoting open discussion reduces the stigma both those with and without mental illnesses hold. This analysis seeks to engage in and start such discussions."

One survey was performed in 2014 and the other in 2016. Both of the surveys seek to understand how people that work in technology view mental health issues and to understand what support they receive from their employer.\n",

    "### Background and Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing a better understanding of technology workers' views on mental health issues is inherently a human-centered project. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) defines stigma as one person viewing another in a negative way due to a mental illness.[[3]](#References) Understanding how tech workers view this stigma and assessing the basics of services the company they work for provides allows us to start the discussion around how to reduce the stigma around the perception of mental health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this analysis we will be exploring sentiment from IT workers about mental health and if employer provided mental health benefits have improved between the two surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "This brings us to our two research questions. For both, we will be using a two-sample proportion z-test to evaluate if there has been a change between the two surveys for the hypothesis we're testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### RQ1: Sentiment Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "In this research question I want to explore if the overall sentiment of tech workers on mental health has improved from the 2014 survey to the 2016 survey. Singletary et al. determined that 13-year old children tended to perceive being healthy as meaning physical well-being as opposed to mental well-being [[6]](#References). I believe that technology workers will share this same perception.\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1a:** More negative perception of discussing mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the findings of Singletary et al., I also hypothesize that how people perceive the consequences of discussing mental illness with their employer has not changed between the two surveys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1b:** Perception of discussing mental health between surveys hasn't changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate these hypotheses, we will be comparing the proportions of participants answers to \"Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?\" and \"Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?\" between surveys. Participants will be classified based on if their perception of the consequences of discussing mental health issues is greater than, less than or equal to their perception of the consequences for discussing a physical ailment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### RQ2: Benefit Coverage Increase\n",
    "\n",
    "For our second research question, we want to examine if there has been an increase in coverage of mental health benefits among tech workers. As this study is primarily made up of individuals in the United States, my belief is that coverage will have increased due to benefits from The Affordable Care Act as many millions of people have gained healthcare from this bill. [[7]](#References)\n",
    "\n",
    "**H2a:** Increase in percent of tech workers with mental health benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prove this hypothesis, we will be comparing the proportion of survey participants who answered yes to \"Does your employer provide mental health benefits?\" between the two surveys. We will also explore if country is a confounding variable."

    "##### Research Question 1 (RQ1)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first research question, we have two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1a:** More negative perception of discussing mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "**H1b:** Perception of discussing mental health between surveys hasn't changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The metric we'll be using to establish a survey participant's view on mental health will use the answers to \"Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?\" and \"Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with your employer would have negative consequences?\" For each question a user can answer \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Maybe\" or in the 2016 survey, they could opt to leave the questions blank. If they opted out of either question, we will filter that out for our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way the metric is established is by comparing the participant's answers. For example, if a user answered \"Yes\" to the question about discussing mental health and \"No\" to the question about discussing physical health, the user would be categorized as perceiving mental health more negatively. If the inverse was true, then the user would be categorized as perceiving mental health less negatively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll first look at the distributions for each survey to answer **H1a**. We use the function *get_perception_of_mental_health_score* to create our aggregated DataFrame. We then plot the results."

    "### Discussion/Limitations"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Limitations of Study\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the potential limitations of the results of the analysis stem from how the data were collected. The survey was promoted through OSMI's Twitter [[4]](#References) and sites focusing on mental health issues in the tech industry like [BlueHackers](http://bluehackers.org/2016/04/02/osmi-mental-health-in-tech-survey-2016). Individuals that are likely to visit these sites or to follow OSMI on Twitter would seemingly be more likely to be open about discussing mental health issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "All data provided in the survey was self-reported and the majority of responses in both surveys come from the United States (59.7% in 2014 and 58.6% in 2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "While both surveys contain the same subset of questions, the 2016 survey contains many more questions than the 2014 survey and allows the user to go into greater detail to qualify their answers. This limits our ability to compare the more qualitative answers users had the option to provide. The questions that are similar between the surveys generally provided a Yes/No/Maybe response. The results of this analysis for quantifying sentiment around mental health issues should be understood alongside the potential biases of the data sets given these limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Importance of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question one should ask after reading this analysis is \"Why do people tend to view discussing mental health as having more consequences than discussing physical health in the workplace?\" Beginning to discuss why people tend to have this attitude is the first step in shifting the perception of discussing mental health to not carry as much of a stigma. It is surprising that the second most common perception around discussing physical and mental health in the workplace was that there would not be consequences for such discussions. In the section below, we suggest that increasing the range of answers for these questions would potentially lead to clearer results for the metric we devised.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is heartening to see that mental health coverage has increased between the two surveys but that finding should be taken with a grain of salt given the noted limitations in how this data was collected. A more thorough survey conducted through a government agency would give a better sense of how coverage has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Future Research Questions/Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the brevity of this study, there are several outstanding questions that weren't covered in the analysis. The foremost was that given mental health care coverage increased between the two studies and that our metric for perception of discussing mental health didn't change, \"How long does it take for the stigma around discussing mental health to lessen given that access to mental health care is more available?\" It would also be interesting to investigate if there is a correlation between factors such as age or country of origin that shift the distribution of perception around discussing mental health.\n",
    "\n",
    "In regards to the limitations of the study, it would be beneficial to future research if the survey included a question about how users found the survey so that future surveys could be promoted from a larger variety of sources. It would also help if the range of answers was quantifiable rather than qualitative. This would provide a more precise scale for a survey participant to express their opinion around the perceived consequences around discussing mental or physical health in the workplace."

    "### Conclusion"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "| Hypothesis | Description | Supported? |\n",
    "| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |\n",
    "| **H1a** | Survey participants will have a more negative perception around discussing mental health. | Yes |\n",
    "| **H1b** | Perception of discussing mental health between surveys hasn't changed. | Yes |\n",
    "| **H2a** | Increase in percent of tech workers with mental health benefits. | Yes |\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first research question we sought to analyze if the overall sentiment of tech workers surveyed had improved between the 2014 and 2016 surveys. We found that within both surveys tech workers more often had a more negative perception of discussing mental health within the workplace than discussing physical health. We showed that there was not a statistically significant difference in the proportion of survey participants that had a more negative perception of discussing mental health between the two surveys. Both **H1a** and **H1b** were supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Research Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second research question we examined if a larger percent of participants in the 2016 survey had mental health coverage than in the 2014 survey. We found that in 2016 a larger proportion of survey participants reported that they had mental health benefits. We also found that this was true within and outside the United States. **H2a** was supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Understanding of Human-Centered Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this report is to foster discussions about the stigma around openly discussing mental health issues. We specifically take a look into this stigma within the tech industry through surveys provided by OSMI. In this case, understanding that the surveyed workers tended to view discussing mental health issues as having more potential consequences than discussing physical health issues opens the door to discuss why that might be the case. This is inherently human-centered as two of the values of human-centered data science are *openness* and *social impact*."
